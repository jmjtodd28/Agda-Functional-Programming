## Part I: More on length

Besides `map`, the function `reverse` is another example of a length-preserving
operation.

```agda
 length-of-reverse : {A : Type} (xs : List A)
                   ‚Üí length (reverse xs) ‚â° length xs
 length-of-reverse []        = refl 0
 length-of-reverse (x :: xs) =
   length (reverse xs ++ [ x ])       ‚â°‚ü® length-of-++ (reverse xs) [ x ] ‚ü©
   length (reverse xs) + length [ x ] ‚â°‚ü® refl _                          ‚ü©
   length (reverse xs) + 1            ‚â°‚ü® ap (_+ 1) IH                    ‚ü©
   length xs + 1                      ‚â°‚ü® +-comm (length xs) 1            ‚ü©
   1 + length xs                      ‚àé
    where
     IH : length (reverse xs) ‚â° length xs
     IH = length-of-reverse xs
```

**Prove** the above.

## Part II: More on isomorphisms

### Exercise 2a

```agda
 ‚Ñï-[‚ãÜ]-iso : ‚Ñï ‚âÖ List ùüô
 ‚Ñï-[‚ãÜ]-iso = record { bijection = f ; bijectivity = f-is-bijection }
  where
   f : ‚Ñï ‚Üí List ùüô
   f 0       = []
   f (suc n) = ‚ãÜ :: f n

   g : List ùüô ‚Üí ‚Ñï
   g []        = 0
   g (‚ãÜ :: ‚ãÜs) = suc (g ‚ãÜs)

   gf : g ‚àò f ‚àº id
   gf 0       = refl 0
   gf (suc n) = ap suc (gf n)

   fg : f ‚àò g ‚àº id
   fg [] = refl []
   fg (‚ãÜ :: ‚ãÜs) = ap (‚ãÜ ::_) (fg ‚ãÜs)

   f-is-bijection : is-bijection f
   f-is-bijection = record { inverse = g ; Œ∑ = gf ; Œµ = fg }
```

**Show** that the type of natural numbers `‚Ñï` is isomorphic to the type of lists
over the unit type `ùüô`.

Hint: The statement of Exercise 2b may help you.

### Exercise 2b

```agda
 open _‚âÖ_

 ‚Ñï‚Üí[‚ãÜ]-preserves-length : (n : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí length (bijection ‚Ñï-[‚ãÜ]-iso n) ‚â° n
 ‚Ñï‚Üí[‚ãÜ]-preserves-length zero = refl 0
 ‚Ñï‚Üí[‚ãÜ]-preserves-length (suc n) = ap suc (‚Ñï‚Üí[‚ãÜ]-preserves-length n)
```

Notice how `bijection` extracts the function `f` you defined in `‚Ñï-[‚ãÜ]-iso`.

**Prove** that for any `n : ‚Ñï`, the length of the list `f n : List ùüô`
(where `f : ‚Ñï ‚Üí List ùüô` is as you defined in Exercise 3a) is `n`.

## Part III: More on evenness

In this exercise, we will continue where we left off in the lab exercises on
evenness. Recall the predicates `is-even` and `check-even`:

```agda
 is-even : ‚Ñï ‚Üí Type
 is-even x = Œ£ y Íûâ ‚Ñï , x ‚â° 2 * y
```

Now recall the discussion about decidable predicates that we had in the previous
weeks. When you proved that `check-even` and `is-even` are logically equivalent
in the lab, you have in fact implicitly proved that `is-even` is a decidable
predicate! In this exercise, we will make this implicit proof _explicit_.

**Complete** the remaining holes in the following proof outline; starting with
proving a lemma stating that a Boolean is either `true` or `false`.

```agda
 principle-of-bivalence : (b : Bool) ‚Üí (b ‚â° true) ‚àî (b ‚â° false)
 principle-of-bivalence true  = inl (refl true)
 principle-of-bivalence false = inr (refl false)

 is-even-is-decidable : (n : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí is-decidable (is-even n)
 is-even-is-decidable n =
  ‚àî-nondep-elim goal‚ÇÅ goal‚ÇÇ (principle-of-bivalence (check-even n))
   where
    goal‚ÇÅ : check-even n ‚â° true ‚Üí is-decidable (is-even n)
    goal‚ÇÅ p = inl (check-even‚áíeven n p)

    goal‚ÇÇ : check-even n ‚â° false ‚Üí is-decidable (is-even n)
    goal‚ÇÇ p = inr subgoal
     where
      subgoal : ¬¨ is-even n
      subgoal q = true-is-not-false
                   (true        ‚â°‚ü® sym (even‚áícheck-even n q) ‚ü©
                   check-even n ‚â°‚ü® p ‚ü©
                   false        ‚àé)
```

## Part IV: Stretcher exercises on length

*The following two exercises are rather hard and are should be interesting to
students that like a challenge.*

Recall that we can define `filter` as
```agda
 filter : {A : Type} ‚Üí (A ‚Üí Bool) ‚Üí List A ‚Üí List A
 filter P []        = []
 filter P (x :: xs) = if P x then (x :: ys) else ys
  where
   ys = filter P xs
```

We also remind you of the inductively defined less-than-or-equal relation `‚â§`
on the natural numbers.

```agda
 data _‚â§_ : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï ‚Üí Type where
   ‚â§-zero : (  y : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí 0 ‚â§ y
   ‚â§-suc  : (x y : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí x ‚â§ y ‚Üí suc x ‚â§ suc y
```

Finally, the following lemmas are provided to you for your convenience.

```agda
 ‚â§-suc-lemma : (n : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí n ‚â§ (1 + n)
 ‚â§-suc-lemma 0       = ‚â§-zero (1 + 0)
 ‚â§-suc-lemma (suc n) = goal
  where
   IH : n ‚â§ (1 + n)
   IH = ‚â§-suc-lemma n
   goal : suc n ‚â§ suc (suc n)
   goal = ‚â§-suc n (suc n) IH

 Bool-elim : (A : Bool ‚Üí Type)
           ‚Üí A false
           ‚Üí A true
           ‚Üí (x : Bool) ‚Üí A x
 Bool-elim A x‚ÇÄ x‚ÇÅ false = x‚ÇÄ
 Bool-elim A x‚ÇÄ x‚ÇÅ true  = x‚ÇÅ
```

### Exercise 4a (stretcher üå∂)

**Prove** that filtering a list decreases its length.

```agda
 ‚â§-trans : (x y z : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí x ‚â§ y ‚Üí y ‚â§ z ‚Üí x ‚â§ z
 ‚â§-trans zero y z p q
  = ‚â§-zero z
 ‚â§-trans (suc x) .(suc y) .(suc z) (‚â§-suc .x y p) (‚â§-suc .y z q)
  = ‚â§-suc x z (‚â§-trans x y z p q)

+-assoc : (x y z : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí (x + y) + z ‚â° x + (y + z)
+-assoc 0       y z = refl (y + z)
+-assoc (suc x) y z =
   (suc x + y) + z   ‚â°‚ü® refl _ ‚ü©
   suc (x + y) + z   ‚â°‚ü® refl _ ‚ü©
   suc ((x + y) + z) ‚â°‚ü® ap suc (+-assoc x y z) ‚ü©
   suc (x + (y + z)) ‚â°‚ü® refl _ ‚ü©
   suc x + (y + z)   ‚àé
```

*Hints*:
 - You can use `‚â§-trans` from the [sample solutions to
   Lab 4](lab4-solutions.lagda.md) if you need that `‚â§` is transitive.
   (The sample solutions are already imported for you.)
 - Think about how to use `Bool-elim`.

### Exercise 4b (stretcher üå∂üå∂)

Given a predicate `P : A ‚Üí Bool` and a list `xs : List A`, we could filter `xs`
by `P` and by `not ‚àò P`. If we do this and compute the lengths of the resulting
lists, then we expect their sum to be equal to the length of the unfiltered list
`xs`. **Prove** this fact.

```agda
length-of-filter : {A : Type} (P : A ‚Üí Bool) (xs : List A)
                 ‚Üí length (filter P xs) ‚â§ length xs

length-of-filter P (x :: xs) = Bool-elim goal-statement false-case
                                                          true-case

  where
   ys = filter P xs

   {- Note that by definition
        filter P (x :: xs) = if P x then (x :: ys) else ys
      and so goal-statement is almost
        length (filter P (x :: xs)) ‚â§ length (x :: xs)
      except that we replace "P x" by the Boolean "b". -}
   goal-statement : Bool ‚Üí Type
   goal-statement b = length (if b then (x :: ys) else ys) ‚â§ length (x :: xs)

   IH : length ys ‚â§ length xs
   IH = length-of-filter P xs

   {- The type of "false-case" is equal to "goal-statement false". -}
   false-case : length ys ‚â§ length (x :: xs)
