# Activity Plan for Week 7

This week we have our first test which will count for 40% of your module mark.

In lecture on Wednesday, we will start talking about abstract total orders and using them to give more precise data types and specifying sorted lists.

### Attend the in-person Test on Monday 4-6pm
Instead of the usual lab session, Test 1 will take place Monday 4-6pm in LG04. It is expected that every student turn up for this test.

Some clarifications about the test:
 * The test is taken under exam conditions just as the Practice Test.
 * You are required to do it in the lab. You will need to sign attendance in the lab.
 * You are allowed to use your own machine. (You can also use a lab machine, if you wish.)
 * You are allowed to use the module material on GitLab. This includes sample solutions.
 * You are allowed to use the Agda manual online, as well as the emacs cheatsheet and the resources we gave you on GitLab.
 * You are allowed to use your own solutions and notes.
 * You are not allowed to use your phone, google search, chat, email etc.
 * Please put your phone on silent inside your bag under the table.
 * You need to bring your student id and put on the table.
 * Make sure you submit to Canvas from time to time. The last submission will be marked.
 * You must submit by 17:50 sharp. 
 * Submissions close at 18:00 sharp, and submissions from 17:51 onwards get 5% penalty.
 * No submissions are accepted after 18:00.
 * RAP students get extra time as usual (to be set on Canvas) based on the information that the Welfare Team sends us. They also get a 10 minute additional time with 5% penalty.
