# Activity Plan for Week 1

## What you have to do all weeks

We expect you to work for 13 hours every week on this module, as follows:

 * 2 hours in the Lab LG4 (Computer Science building) **16:00-18:00 on Mondays.**
   We expect most students to use their own laptops, but there are 10 machines available for students who don't own a laptop, which should be enough.

 * In some weeks, however, there will be an assessed test in the Lab LG04. Check [Canvas Assignments](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/72991/assignments).

 * 2 hours attending in person lectures **10:00-12:00 on Wednesdays** in Law LT3, building R1 in the red zone of the [campus map](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/contact/directions/index.aspx).

 * 9 hours studying handouts, possibly also watching recorded lectures about them, doing unassessed but mandatory exercises, and recording your performance on Canvas.

## What you have to do this week

   It is mandatory to join Teams, as we use it an active part of learning and communication.

 * Reach the lecturers and teaching assistants in the lab and their office hours.

### Attend the Monday Lab

Follow the instructions given in the [Lab 1 sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab1.lagda.md).

 * We will help you to install Agda in your own machine and teach you how to edit Agda programs with the emacs interface.

 * The first lab is crucial. Make sure you don't miss it. In general you should not miss any lab, as it includes taught material delivered by the lecturers.

### Read handouts for this week

 * [Introduction](/files/LectureNotes/files/introduction.lagda.md)

 * [Resources](/files/Resources/resources.md)

### Attend the Wednesday lecture

### Watch videos for this week (optional)

The videos are not mandatory if you can manage to understand the handouts.
The lectures will repeat what is in the videos, but not everything. This is because we will both explain and discuss the material of the handouts, and sometimes do things that are not in the handouts or the videos.
