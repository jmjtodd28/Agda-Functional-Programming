# Activity Plan for Week 5

### Make sure you have completed the exercises from previous weeks
 * [Lab 2 sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab2.lagda.md)
 * [Lab 3 sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab3.lagda.md)
 * [Lab 4 sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab4.lagda.md)
 * Report your performance via the Canvas quizzes
 * We have now published [solutions to all of these exercises](/files/LectureNotes/files/solutions/).

### Complete the homework sheet
 * [Homework sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/homework5.lagda.md)

The homework sheet takes the place of the lab sheet for this week.
You can use the homework sheet as practice for the Practice Test.
Make sure that you complete it during this week.

### Attend the in-person Practice Test on Monday 4-6pm
Instead of the usual lab session, we will have the Practice Test on Monday 4-6pm in LG04. It is expected that every student turn up for this test.

Some clarifications about the test:
 * We will run it under exam conditions so that you know the drill for Test 1 in Week 7. 
 * So you are required to do it in the lab. You will need to sign attendance in the lab.
 * You are allowed to use your own machine. (You can also use a lab machine, if you wish.)
 * You are allowed to use the module material on GitLab. This includes sample solutions.
 * You are allowed to use the Agda manual online, as well as the emacs cheatsheet and the resources we gave you on GitLab.
 * You are allowed to use your own solutions and notes.
 * You are not allowed to use your phone, google search, chat, email etc.
 * Please put your phone on silent inside your bag under the table.
 * You need to bring your student id and put on the table.
 * Make sure you submit to Canvas from time to time. The last submission will be marked.
 * You must submit by 17:50 sharp. 
 * Submissions close at 18:00 sharp, and submissions from 17:51 onwards get 5% penalty.
 * No submissions are accepted after 18:00.
 * RAP students get extra time as usual (to be set on Canvas) based on the information that the Welfare Team sends us. They also get a 10 minute additional time with 5% penalty.

### Read handouts for this week

You can get started looking at the material for the lecture after the practice test:

 1. Read more about ismorphisms:
    1. The [isomorphism template](/files/LectureNotes/files/isomorphism-template.lagda.md)
    1. [Isomorphism as an equivalence relation](/files/LectureNotes/files/isomorphism-functions.lagda.md)
 1. Read about more types, their elimination principles, and their isomorphisms:
    1. [Boolean type isomorphism](/files/Bool-functions.lagda.md)
    1. [Maybe type](/files/LectureNotes/files/Maybe.lagda.md)
    1. [Finite types](/files/LectureNotes/files/Fin.lagda.md)
    1. [Lists](/files/LectureNotes/files/List-functions.lagda.md), [Vectors](/files/LectureNotes/files/Vector-functions.lagda.md) and [their isomorphisms](/files/LectureNotes/files/vector-and-list-isomorphisms.lagda.md)

### Attend the lecture on Wednesday 10am-12pm

  We will talk about the material covered in the isormorphism handouts above.

### Homework: Complete the homework sheet exercises by the end of this week

 * They are unassessed.

 * But you must report your performance on Canvas.

 * We will provide [solutions](/files/LectureNotes/files/solutions/).
