# Activity Plan for Week 6

This is revision week, and so there is no new material, other than a few new exercises.

The lab and the lectures will be as normal, but we instead will do
examples of the material already covered in the previous weeks.

### Attend the Lab on Monday 4-6pm

You will work on previous weeks exercises, or, if you have already completed them, in the new lab sheet.

### Attend the lecture on Wednesday 10am-12pm

We will solve problems based on the material of Weeks 1-5.

## How to revise

### Make sure you have completed the exercises from previous weeks

 * [Lab 2 sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab2.lagda.md)
 * [Lab 3 sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab3.lagda.md)
 * [Lab 4 sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab4.lagda.md)
 * [Homework 5 sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/homework5.lagda.md)
 * Report your performance via the Canvas quizzes
 * We have now published [solutions to all of these exercises](/files/LectureNotes/files/solutions/).

### Attempt the two practice tests again if you haven't done well

 * [Lab Practice Test](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/practice-test.lagda.md)
 * [Practice Test from last year](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/practice-test-2023.lagda.md)

### Study the solutions for everything

But only after attempting the exercises yourself.

 * [Solutions](/files/LectureNotes/files/solutions)

### Full set of lecture notes

 * [Lecture notes](/files/LectureNotes/README.md)

### The above should be enough to revise

But if you need more exercises, they are available here:
