 1. We use [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3akoy5Xsf2j2ToFwTArOQmcibDFP1FlGbwtzNxmdEeUuA1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=a8521c67-7a73-4309-af69-9b6a19817466&tenantId=b024cacf-dede-4241-a15c-3c97d553e9f3) to make announcements, give you help and answer questions about the module.

    Please don't use email to ask questions about the module - ask them on Teams, as there are three lecturers and two TA's to help everybody there. If you have a question, it is very likely that more students have the same question, and they will benefit from both reading the question and the answers.
